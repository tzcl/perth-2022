# Svelte Starter Kit

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte and TypeScript in Vite.

## Why use this over SvelteKit?

SvelteKit comes with more features but is much heavier. This kit is designed for creating simple SPAs where the benefits of SvelteKit aren't as important. It's easy to migrate to SvelteKit if necesary.

## Features

This kit comes integrated with TailwindCSS and provides automatic formatting and sorting of classes in Svelte components.
